# Required Files and Programs

### 3DSMax 7

Since the plugins we have are old and the granny version used for Metin2 is old, it is one of the programs that should be on your computer. If you don't know how to install, download the video from [this link.](https://mega.nz/file/UepmDSjC#-kUKlCMNgyfZPe0nXk5NYG2tG5EuhP5KeaLdGlAMLFU)

### 3DSMax 2008

We will use it for animation import, mesh and bone connection. Definitely a must have program.
I don't see any problem in sharing it since Autodesk has withdrawn its support. The only difference from 7 is that you have to install the hotfix of the relevant version after installing. Hotfixes are in the archive. Install the 32bit version because the plugins I provide are only for the 32bit version.
