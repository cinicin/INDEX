# Antik Titan Set

![FAIL](/ASSETS/3D/30.gif)

While browsing my huge ass fuck archive, I came across an unpack archive, I probably downloaded it from here, it belongs to a server named NW2, I may be wrong, I'm not a follower of pvp servers.
This set comes from there...

There are 3 folders in the archive you will download,,

1. Orjinal
2. Versiyon 1
3. Versiyon 2

**Orjinal Folder**:

The files I took to work on the unpack I mentioned, The characters are almost completely changed, their bone structures are the same, so you can add them to the game and have a look, but the main location is not **ymir work**, it's **worktree**, you need to add accordingly. The icons are in this folder from there, you can examine them, there is a separate icon for each body model, so you can use it as a costume...

**Versiyon 1 Folder**:

In armours, I just changed the heads and fixed the texture locations, and made a few minor tweaks.
I arranged the hairstyles according to the original heads because their positions were different, the ears or something was outside, and the hair was flying in the air.​
On the weapons, I fixed the texture positions and made some corrections. It may seem like no difference when you try it, but the devil is in the details. You can understand the difference between the original and version 1 from the spoiler below. In general, there is not much change between version 1 and the original files, except for minor details, granny versions and texture locations, the sizes of the models are the same. However, I do not know who prepared these models, but their tastes are a little different from mine, the models are too big for me, that's why I prepared version 2 according to my taste.

**Versiyon 2 Folder**:

In my opinion, there are models in this folder that are more properly styled, hairstyles are the same as version 1, armours are just textured, alpha channels are a bit different, and in some armours, when adjusting textures, I may have exaggerated the reflection a bit, but I didn't fix it back because the community likes it garish. For example, take a look at the picture. Before we get to the previews, let me mention it again, if you find the reflections too much, replace the textures with the first version...
​ ​
Let's start with the weapons first. In Version2, I edited the dimensions and made the models a little more meaningful, otherwise, some models looked too big and absurd, as you can see from the pictures... Also as a dagger, there was something like a Lycan claw in the room, I remodelled it.​

Now let's move on to Armor and hairstyles, these previews are from version 2, the only difference from version 1 is the textures, again, if you think it's too reflective, you can fix it... Also, the helmet's hairstyle is not dependent on armour models so don't be misunderstood...
